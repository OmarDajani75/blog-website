  <h3 style="color: #33cccc;"> Chicago flight back home!</h3>
  <div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 16th, 2020</h4></div>

  <p style="color: #ffcc00">I’m currently writing all of this inside my flight to Chicago. This flight acts as a connecting flight, which means I’ll stop in Chicago but then head straight for home in another plane when I land. <br /> <br />
This plane is a bit on the emptier side, which makes sense all things considered. As a result of this, there is legit no one sitting next to me. There’s 2 besides next to me, and no one is sitting on them. How lucky is that? I’m ecstatic about this. Felt great! (And no, this wasn’t because of corona. Other people had others sitting next to them. I guess I just got lucky? I’ll take it!) <br /> <br />
Kept myself busy with watching The Mandalorian. This Chicago flight is 3 and a half hours or something, so might as well. Continued filling out my journal as well as practice making websites as well. Did whatever I could to pass the time! <br /> <br />
Going back to the topic of the plane being on the emptier side, the same extends to LAX as well. This is obviously due to corona, but the date and time of this Chicago flight (Saturday at 11 AM) probably contributed a bit to this as well. As someone with social anxiety, I legit have no complaints about this. This was awesome! Seeing an airport be a bit empty was weird, to say the least. <br /> <br />
This is gonna sound kinda strange, but I actually like airplane food. I know, I’m a weirdo, but something about eating on a plane is.. fun to me? Kinda hard to explain, but yeah. Considering this flight was a short one, there was sadly no food. Sucks, but I got over it fast. Happy that the proper flight back home has some dinner, at least! Definitely looking forward to that. <br /> <br />
Pro-tip: make sure you have a bunch of music downloaded and stuff. Made the plane ride a bit less boring. Thanks, Spotify. <br /> <br />
Coming to the airport, I was pretty weird my bag was too heavy, with all the stuff inside it and all. Thankfully, I barely didn’t hit the 50 pound limit, so thank god for me! I think I was like.. 45 pounds? 46? 47? Something like that. <br /> <br />
Going back to the topic of music, listen to the 5PM theme from Animal Crossing: New Horizons. That song felt oddly fitting for the plane ride. Very relaxing. <br /> <br />
Did I mention how surreal it is to be writing all of this while I’m, literally, in the sky? This is dope! <br /> <br />
I also passed some time by continuing to fill out the Stanford application, as well as continuing to edit my first ever publication! <br /> <br />
This is it for the Chicago flight! Go check out the back home one for the stuff about that specific experience. Wanted to put them both in one big post, but thought it’d be too long, so yeah.</p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Traveling alone</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 17th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="TA.jpeg" /></center>
<p>Back in high school, I never thought there would eventually be a time where I would need to travel alone. <br /> <br />
I had always dreaded flying. I do not know why, but I just did. I liked being in planes, but the thought of flying for some reason frightened me. My disdain for flying is nothing compared to my disdain for airports, however. I dislike flying, but I genuinely think I hate airports. Yeah, “hate” is a strong word, but I think it is perfect to describe how I feel about airports. <br /> <br />
It is likely my social anxiety, but I really dislike being in airports. There are just.. so many people around. It is easy to feel overwhelmed, and I am the type of person who does not handle feelings of overwhelm well. Besides that, I also have a horrid sense of direction, which is bad for a place like the airport, even with all the signs. Due to all this, I tried to avoid airports as much as I could.. up until quite recently. <br /> <br />
When it was time for me to come to America, I obviously had to deal with both airports and flying, due to the whole “being Palestinian” thing. I was not looking forward to this at all let me tell you that. I remember the first time I ever left home and came to America.. it was really intense to say the least. My mom and sister were with me and escorted me through the airport, but when it was time to say goodbye to them both? I felt so awful seeing them disappear from sight. Even though this was a whole year and a half ago, it still makes me uncomfortable remembering all this, but I am a lot better now. <br /> <br />
I visited Palestine back during last year’s winter break, which meant I had to go through the airport business yet again. This time though, I was completely alone. No one to escort me through LAX and no one for me to feel comforted by. This was scary.. but it actually also was not that bad? Like, at all? It might be the fact that the airport back home is trashy, but I found navigating through LAX quite easy. Going back home was not anywhere near as nerve-wracking as it was leaving it. <br /> <br />
Coming back to America towards the end of winter break sucked. Not because of the airport, but because I had to say goodbye to my mom yet again. My sister could not come with us this time to see me off, so it was just my mom and I. I hated saying bye to my mom. Thinking back on this also makes me feel uncomfortable, if I am being honest. <br /> <br />
I am soon going to go back home for another visit. Yeah, I’ll travel alone.. but I am not worried. It’ll be fine! I am excited to finally see my family after a whole year of not seeing them thanks to a certain virus. I can already tell having to say goodbye to them will sting yet again though, but I will make sure I do not let it get to me too much. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Meister</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 18th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="Comfort.jpeg" /></center>
<p>During one of my years of high school, I met a teacher who I will be referring to as Meister for the duration of this blog post. “Meister” became someone extremely important to me over the course of the school year, and although I sadly do not talk to him anymore, he will always be a massive part of my life. Always. <br /> <br />
I remember the first day of the school year in-question. He introduced himself, telling my classmates and I about how he graduated from a prestigious public university in America. I thought this was super cool.. but at the same time, I did not care? Even though I should have probably been taking college stuff more seriously, I barely cared all things considered. I thought it was cool to know someone who graduated from a place so cool, but like.. I did not care too much. <br /> <br />
Over time, I spoke to Meister more and more, eventually becoming pretty much friends with him. This is going to sound so cringey and stupid, but he genuinely understood me, which is why I liked talking to him as much as I did. I was able to tell him something extremely personal due to this, which only made me like him more. Everything was quite good for a while. <br /> <br />
But, yeah. All this changed. I met Meister during a time period of my life where I was heavily missing some important aspects of my social life. Talking to him satisfied all of them, and I was open to him about my secret as well. Because of this, I began to talk to him a lot more than I used to before. He did not appreciate this, which made me pissed back then but now makes sense. It made me pissed as I felt like he did not care about me and hated me, which was not the case at all. He just wanted more time for him to get the chance to talk to other students, which is reasonable, but junior-level of high-school Omar did not get this at the time. I started acting more and more angsty towards him, which made him push me away more and more. <br /> <br />
Eventually, it got to the point where it was obvious he wasn’t the biggest fan of talking to me. This made me only more upset, and I started doing things for the sole purpose of spiting him. This only made us drift even more, and we basically stopped talking the last week of the semester. The only times we did were a few “hey”s and “bye”s.. which only started happening after he made me meet him with the school counselor present. <br /> <br />
We talked about our relationship, and we both agreed to stop talking to each other. This was very hard for me to do, because despite my angst, I still cared about him a lot. Alas, this was the right thing to do in the end, so I obliged. That was the last time Meister and I ever really talked.<br /> <br />
I haven’t seen or heard from him since the last day of school. I sent him an apology email back during the second half of my senior year, but he never replied to it. I don’t even know if he saw it.<br /> <br />
Do I regret what happened? Duh. Meister, safe to say at least, was one of the most important people to me at the time. For me to lose my relationship with him all because I was petty is nothing short of pathetic. I still think about him a lot, and I still wish I could talk to him one last time. Regardless, this has taught me how I shouldn’t take people for granted, and told me how people really do leave your life when they say they will do just that. Depressing. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Computer Science?</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 19th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="CS.jpeg" /></center>
<p>As an English major, I never thought I would get a liking for CS. Those two are such different fields that you wouldn’t expect someone to like both, you know? I guess it isn’t as weird as I’m making it out to but, but still. <br /> <br />
I realized I liked CS not too long ago, actually. I want to say, as of the time I’m posting this, like.. 2 months ago? Sounds like a while, but it really isn’t. I just randomly decided to look into the field more, and was, frankly, shocked at how much I enjoyed reading up on it. <br /> <br />
I watched a variety of CS related videos, and even downloaded CS related books. I’m still an English major, after all. I haven’t been able to do much progress on the books considering I’m so busy, but they’re still there in my library. I’ll get to reading them when I can for sure. <br /> <br />
From there, I’m now learning how to code. More specifically, I’m learning to code with Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. Sounds like a lot, and it is, but I’m too busy to dedicate too much to this. It sucks, but my coursework and English related stuff takes priority. <br /> <br />
With all of this being said, I now am planning on minoring in CS. I don’t know how easy it’ll be, especially when you consider the hard coursework combined with the hard coursework of the English classes, but I’m committed to it. I don’t want to miss out on something I’m interested in all because I was too worried to give it a shot or whatever. College/University is all about trying out new things and stuff like that, no? <br /> <br />
Coming back home to Palestine and teaching English will be cool, made only cooler with the fact that I can code on the side as well. With this, I am sure my job prospects when I go back home will be fine. I know how to code and I’m good with English? I’m about to thrive! </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Make Mine Marvel</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 15th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="Marvel.jpeg" /></center>
<p>While my personal life got tough a lot, I, thankfully, had a lot of ways to ease off some of the stress. One of these ways was Marvel Comics. I got into that “fandom” at a young age, and I have been hooked ever since. <br /> <br />
Like many others, I found my way to Marvel through Spider-Man. I would watch this show as a kid called Spectacular Spider-Man. I loved the storylines and I greatly enjoyed the character design. From there, my delve into the Marvel universe kept becoming deeper and deeper. <br /> <br />
(Important to note that even though I got into Marvel because of Spider-Man, he was not the first comic book character I ever came across. That honor belongs to Ghost Rider, who also was in the first comic book I ever read. The comic book was scary and had pretty creepy imagery back then, which is why I tend to ignore this aspect and just focus on Spider-Man introducing me to the universe) <br /> <br />
Eventually, Marvel began making movies that were all set in the same universe. These movies, titled “Marvel Cinematic Universe movies”, all took place on the same planet Earth. Meaning, the consequences of one movie would be reflected/and or referenced in another. I thought this was really cool, and it got me into doing something similar in my head. <br /> <br />
I would imagine characters like Captain America existing in the same universe as a video game character or something. The universe I had in my head was very similar to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) but was more expansive. Mine allowed characters from all mediums of fiction to interact with each other, while Marvel’s was solely their own characters. <br /> <br />
Yeah, this sounds kinda dumb. And honestly? It is. But.. it was very fun. And it still is. I still do this “universe” in my head from time to time. It’s enjoyable and makes for a good way to pass time. Back when I was a kid, this stupid universe of mine got me through a lot of bad stuff. It just. It took my mind off of things and made me feel like I was in a world I actually wanted to be part of. <br /> <br />
Marvel still is a part of my life today. The MCU is still going strong and I am greatly enjoying seeing it play out. A bunch of TV shows are slated for release on Disney+, and I am super excited for all of them. In the gaming world, Marvel is currently having a crossover with a game I frequently play called Fortnite. Seeing these iconic Marvel characters in this dumb game is pretty interesting, albeit very bizarre too. <br /> <br />
Marvel has been with me since I was a kid, and I anticipate that they will stay with me through the course of my entire life. I welcome this with open arms. Love that brand. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">America So Far - Part 2</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 15th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="jealousy.jpeg" /></center>
<p>Even with all the time I’ve spent in it so far, it still feels weird to finally be in America. I can’t believe that I’ve been here now for a year and a half.. it’s just such a weird thought. I feel like this is going to be a more “personal” post when compared to Part 1, so there is that if you thought Part 1 was lacking in personality. <br /> <br />
One of my classmates from highschool is in America as well. I was never close with him, but we had a few friendly interactions here and there. I guess you can call us “friendly acquaintances.” He’s in some state to the East, while I’m all the way in the West. Being in California compared to whatever state he is in is seemingly more exciting, but is it really? <br /> <br />
Part of me feels like I’m wasting my time being here, honestly. My former classmate is currently doing a road trip with a few of his friends where they seemingly are going to a bunch of states to explore and sightsee. This made me so jealous when I first realized it. I’ve been studying nonstop since coming here, which is awesome for my GPA, but.. I feel like I’m not truly experiencing what California has to offer, you know? <br /> <br />
I feel like I’m legitimately just too much “all work, no play.” I feel like I’m too caught up with my studies to truly make the most out of me being here.. in an entirely different country from the one I came from. It helps my friend that he has a car to get around in, so I guess some of it is not entirely my direct fault, but still. I just feel so.. jealous. <br /> <br />
Honestly? That’s it with this post. I don’t have much else to say. I just want to try to figure out how to make the most of me being here in America. I can’t let all the time here go to waste on just studying. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Video games</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 15th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="Video games.gif" /></center>
<p>Video games are a huge part of my life. They have been for a very long time, and I assume they will continue to do so forever. <br /> <br />
Pretty bold statement I know, but I mean it. I have to thank video games for making me who I am today, as I don’t think I’ll be the current Omar I am now if it weren’t for them. <br /> <br />
Video games have made me a more hopeful person, a more endearing person (at least, I hope..), a more confident person, a more emphatic person, a more etc etc. I think you get the point, yeah? <br /> <br />
The first video game I remember playing is Pokémon Diamond for the Nintendo DS. Not only was this (probably) my first video game, but it also was my first introduction to a fantasy world I can engross myself in. This game was heavy on reading (albeit basic reading, but still), and I liked that as it truly made me feel engrossed into the world. It helps that it improved my English back then as well. <br /> <br />
From there, I continued playing video games. The next relevant video game I can think of is Kingdom Hearts. This game is a crossover between Disney and Final Fantasy, with the latter being another video game series. Weird concept aside (as the Disney characters look weird in the scenes where you can see them next to Final Fantasy characters), this game is heavy on how your relationships with others are super important, a message shared by the rest of the games in that series. The cheesy message is expected considering the Disney connection, but it’s appreciated all the same. This series taught me to be more empathetic of the others around me, as well as more grateful. <br /> <br />
The most influential game series for me though is definitely Persona. I found out about this series back when I was in 7th grade, and I’ve been enamored with it ever since. Each game in this series has taught me a different life lesson, with the standouts being those of Persona 3, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 is all about accepting death and not being afraid of it, Persona 4 Golden is all about valuing your relationships with others along with always staying true to yourself, and Persona 5 Royal is all about being proud of your differences in life and not letting anyone control you. This is a very brief overview over that series’ themes, but it hopefully gives you an idea of what each game generally talks about. <br /> <br />
My favorite out of these is Persona 4 Golden for sure. This game has a happier tone compared to the other two games, and all the characters are super likable. The game’s message is great, and the way it seamlessly sows it into the story is awesome. Shoutout to Rise Kujikawa! Definitely one of my favorite video games characters. Her story arc is so relatable! <br /> <br />
There are so many more games I can talk about.. legit so many. But, I am going to stop here. Feel like this is all already a lot of info to digest. Maybe I’ll make a part? </p>
