  <h3 style="color: #33cccc;">The High-School Experience</h3>
  <div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 14th, 2020</h4></div>
  <center><img src="Trauma.jpeg" /></center>
  <p>One of the biggest reasons I wanted to come to America was because of my high school experience. While not awful by any means, I would not say it was perfect. It could have been a lot better, and it is interesting to reflect on it now that I am in my sophomore year of college. <br /> <br />
Starting with freshmen year, this was probably the “tamest” of all my high school years. It was before any of the “intense” stuff really started happening, so that is at least something. Academically, I did well. I honestly do not remember much else when it comes to that area for this year. Socially.. I do not really remember either. Give me a break, this was like 4 years ago. All I remember is that this year was very “chill.” <br /> <br />
For sophomore year, my memory is thankfully a lot better. One of the main things I remember this year are how I took classes with the school’s juniors. I do not really remember why, but I think they took some of the same of the classes we did. As a result, we were with them in those classrooms. I was friendly with all of them, and even became friends with most of them. They are all cool and I still talk to one of them every now and then now. She is awesome! <br /> <br />
Speaking of friends, another prominent sophomore year memory is me meeting one of my best friends. I’ll call her “M,” and her and I hit it off right when we met. Her and I are still friends and we still talk quite a bit. I will go into more detail about her later, but just know she is an awesome person and I am super happy I got the chance to meet and become friends with her. <br /> <br />
Another thing I remember is the exchange program I was applying for. This is the last prominent memory when it comes to my sophomore year. Done by an organization back home known as AMIDEAST, the exchange program was a long and intensive application process. You would go to America for a year and get the true American high school experience. You could go to any of the 50 states but I wanted to go to… Florida, weirdly enough. It took me several months to be able to finalize my application, but I sadly did not get accepted. It stung pretty hard honestly, considering all the work and all. One of my friends, who also applied for it, got accepted though and that was pretty nice. He and I were very close at the time, so him being gone for a year (which is how long the accepted students were gone for) being pretty weird to say the least. Took me a bit, but I eventually was able to get over me not being accepted. A big reason why is a certain person I met back in my junior year. <br /> <br />
So.. junior year. I would say that this is probably the best of high school years for me. Main reason is the aforementioned person I met. This person was one of my teachers and I.. just thought he was so cool. He and I became “friends” and we talked to each other a lot. I had genuine fun talking to him and enjoyed his class. He and I eventually became pretty close, and he got kinda involved in my personal life. Thanks to him, I was able to get in contact with a counselor and finally get counseling. This is something I severely needed at the time, and I do not think it would have happened as soon as a it did if it were not for him. <br /> <br />
Besides helping me get counseling, I trusted this guy a lot. Like.. a lot a lot. I had friends, but I felt more comfortable talking to this teacher rather than to them. This made us even closer, and by this point, I realized he was starting to regret this. He was supposed to be my teacher, not my “friend.” He did not necessarily regret our relationship/friendship in a bad sense, but he stopped being a fan. This is because of many reasons, which I will leave for another post. Just know that this person means a lot to me, and although we do not talk any more, he will always mean a lot to me.<br /> <br />
That is it for junior year. Yeah, I know. I said it was the best year out of the high school experience but I only seemed to talk about one memory. You would expect me to share like, a billion, but no. That is really it. This will make more sense when I write the individual post for the teacher. As for now, time to discuss my senior year. <br />
Senior year.. was interesting. A lot of stuff happened this year and sadly, a lot of it was not good. First of all, that aforementioned teacher left. I don’t know the details, but he wasn’t working at school anymore. Honestly? That was the first sign that this year won’t be as good as junior year.<br /> <br />
Second of all, I became so distant from all my classmates. I was already distant from them before, but senior year really brought that home. I still interacted with a lot of them, but at the same time, I just did not care anymore. I do not know why honestly, as you would think I would try to make this year be the best. You know, with it being the last year of high school and all. But.. nope. Looking back, I really regret this. I wish I interacted with all of them more. A lot of them I have not seen (or heard from) ever since we all graduated on June 1st, 2019. I would reach out, but it is kinda awkward, you know? <br /> <br />
Third of all, I just was not having a good time. My depression was thriving and I felt really lonely. Yes, this is kinda my fault considering the above, but I couldn’t help it I guess. <br /> <br />
It feels so surreal to not be in school anymore. In a weird way, I genuinely miss it. I feel like my life was a lot more “set” back then, but that was most likely thanks to me being on a daily routine.<br /> <br />
If I could, would I go back and change how stuff went down? Probably. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">The Visa Processs</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 13th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="F1.jpeg" /></center>
<p>Before I dive deep into some of the more “intense” stuff when it came to America and I, let me talk about getting my visa first. <br /> <br />
For us internationals, the visa is what makes or breaks our ability to come to America. We can come to America for a certain period of time with it, but without it? We cannot even hope to enter. The visa is the way a lot, if not most or all, of us can enter the States. That is why it is so important to get one. <br /> <br />
For me, this entire process took an especially heavy toll on me. “I need this visa if I want to be happy,” I thought to myself. I remember spending an obscene amount of time practicing for the visa interview. I studied for it like you would for a test, writing down a bunch of questions and then going over them over and over. I watched many videos giving advice on how to ace the interview, read many articles on how to make sure I present myself in a “normal” way so I do not risk losing out on the visa for a reason not related to the interview, and lost many hours continuously practicing for this interview. I needed to do good when it came to this interview. Even one mistake can cost me the entire thing. <br /> <br />
On the day of the interview, I woke up feeling extremely anxious. I had everything good to go but I was still worried. In a weird way though, I also was excited. My sister came and picked me up to go to my local U.S. Embassy. Everything was fine and dandy till it was time for my interview. <br /> <br />
It was a mess. The interviewer and I already got off to bad start thanks to me acting awkward when saying hi to him. The rest of the interview was just as awkward, and I could tell the interviewer was over me and wanted me to go. He eventually tells me how my visa has not been approved and sends me on my way with a piece of paper. This paper said how I, thankfully, can have another shot at an interview. I had to go through the entire application process again which sucked, but I was more than willing to do it again if it meant I can be happy. <br /> <br />
So I did just that. I signed up for another interview at the U.S. Embassy located in Tel Aviv. It was annoying to go this one due to the distance from my house, but I did it anyway. Once there, everything was just like the last embassy visit the week prior. Everything but the interview, that is. This time, the interview went great. Interviewer liked me right off the bat and even liked a joke that I made. The interview was going well and eventually, my interviewer says how my visa has been approved. <br /> <br />
I was ecstatic. I worked so hard for this and to actually get it? Awesome. This interview went so much better than the first to the point where it was kind of nuts. I went home feeling extremely accomplished that day, spending my day relaxing and not doing much else as a way to celebrate. A week later, I got my passport back with the F-1 student visa stamp in there. This visa is valid for 5 years, making my sister (who drove me to the post office to get my updated passport) and I even more excited. “This is a lot longer of a time period than we were expecting,” we both said. I was driven back home and spent the day relaxing again. <br /> <br />
Overall, I am glad the visa process went the way it did. While it sucked to get rejected the first time, I was thankfully given a second chance. I seized this opportunity and was able to get my visa then. The next 3 weeks were me mainly getting ready for my arrival to America. I spent a lot of those days hanging out with some friends as a way to say goodbye to them for the time being. But.. I will go into more detail about this later. Just know that I am overjoyed with how everything related to this worked out. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">America So Far - Part 1</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 12th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="American Map.jpeg" /></center>
<p>I’ve been living in America for a little more than a year now. How does it compare thus far to how I’ve imagined it before back in Palestine? <br /> <br />
This is.. weird to answer. I thought America would be some sort of safe-haven after moving here, but honestly? It is very.. normal? I don’t know how to exactly explain it, but yeah. It definitely “feels” different, but isn’t all that I imagined it out to be. <br /> <br />
What do I mean by “feels” different? Well, people here are a lot more interesting to be around. Most people back home were all very similar, while people over here are a lot more diverse. Ever since coming here, I have come across African Americans, Hispanics, LGBT people, among so many other groups. I feel like my “world view” has improved significantly, and I am so grateful for that. It’s just cool, you know? The world is filled with different people from different countries and stuff, so being in the space to get to interact with said people is rad. I love it! <br /> <br />
Besides that, I’ve definitely become more social ever since I’m come here. I’m still an introvert at heart, but I have a lot more extroverted characteristics for sure. This feels.. great! It genuinely feels awesome. I never thought I would be this way, but I’m glad. I regularly interact with both my landlord as well as his friends, and while everything is online which sucks, I’m still doing my best to make friends in my classes. I’m proud of myself! (This current quarantine especially has made me more extroverted. This is quite surprising for me, as I never thought being forced to stay inside would make me more social. I guess it makes sense when you think about it more though) <br /> <br />
But even with all that being said, it doesn’t feel that much different than how stuff felt back in Palestine, as stated earlier. If I was as social as I am now back then, I don’t think my memories of Palestine would be such a departure from who I am as a person now. Really, a lot of the differences between now and then involve my social-ness. Yeah, that ain’t a word, but you get me. This likely sounds super generic, like “the potential was within me all along! I just needed to believe!” but I genuinely feel this way. I wish I could go back and have a second chance at a lot of the stuff that happened back home, but whatever. I’m happy that I realized this stuff now, so hopefully it won’t get in the way again in the future. <br /> <br />
This is all the surface of my experience in America thus far. More stuff will be discussed in future parts. Stay tuned!</p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Florida..?</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 11th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="Florida.jpeg" /></center>
<p>I think it is worth pointing out that I, originally at least, never planned on coming to California. I actually was supposed to go to Florida for my studies. <br /> <br />
If you ask me why.. I honestly don’t know? I found out about this university called the University of Central Florida. From there, I guess I got really “attached” to it and couldn’t see myself going anywhere else. For the longest time, that university was my sole goal and was where I was planning on going to. Again, I don’t know why. <br /> <br />
If I had to guess, part of the reason why I was so fixated on going to that school was the people. I looked up “University of Central Florida” up on Facebook (back when I cared to use it, mind you. This was like.. 2015? 2016?) and saw some cool looking people. Yes, I think that is seriously a reason why I wanted to go there. The people “looked cool” and I could see myself being able to get along with the likes of them pretty well. This, of course, didn’t end up happening. <br /> <br />
Hell, I wasn’t even planning on going to the University of Central Florida from the get-go. I was gonna go to a nearby community college called Valencia College. From there, I would transfer into UCF. I got through the Valencia College application quite a bit, and I think I even paid for it, but I never ended up going there upon my acceptance. I got the chance to come to California, and that is what I ended up deciding to do. <br /> <br />
Do I regret it? Not really. I heard some.. very “interesting” things about Florida, to say the least. I don’t think I would have really “fit in” over there. People seem very conservative there and it just isn’t my scene, you feel me? Plus, the weather seems like it sucks. Listen, I know the weather here in SoCal isn’t any better, but I’ll take it.</p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">America and my Palestinian Identity</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 10th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="Palestine.webp" /></center>
<p>Ever since coming to America, I have felt myself becoming more and more “American” by the minute. I was always like this (to an extent) before I came over to the States, but this feeling was definitely amplified by me actually being in the country. While I am not necessarily opposed to becoming more “American,” I do think it is important to keep my Palestinian identity with me no matter what, which I think I have been doing a good job of. <br /> <br />
Coming to America has made me appreciate Palestine so much more. I definitely did not even come close to hating it before, but I was not exactly the biggest fan of it either. I thought it lacked so much in comparison to America and other countries, but that mindset has now been altered. I still think it is lacking in some aspects compared to a place like America, but I appreciate it a lot more now for what it does have. I appreciate the history, the people, the food, the locations, all of this stuff that makes Palestine what it is so much more now.<br /> <br />
There’s definitely a lot of aspects of my culture I still do not approve of, though. Examples include the views towards women, masculinity, LGBT+ matters, and pretty much any social justice related topic you can think of. Palestinians, sadly, are “backwards” when it comes to these topics, which definitely sucks. But, they are improving little by little every once in a while, so that is at least good. I do not think the Palestinian side of Jerusalem will become like San Francisco with the levels of liberty anytime soon, but I am happy that it is at least seemingly taking baby steps.. even if they seem to be very small ones. <br /> <br />
It’s just.. so weird to me. I always viewed Palestine through such “meh” lenses, so me suddenly changing my perspective and being a lot more fond of it now is so strange. Is it nostalgia? Is it maturity? I do not know.. and I do not really care either. I am happy and content with this new resolution either way. I am glad I underwent this character development!</p>
