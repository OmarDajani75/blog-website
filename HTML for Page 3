  <p>Music is a huge and essential aspect of my life. I know how I’m not even slightly close to being the only person who feels that way, but that truly is how it is for me. I can’t imagine my life without music. I can legitimately say music was one of the best things humans invented. I love it that much. <br /> <br />
Besides the typical “love for music” stuff you likely have heard numerous times before, I want to specifically talk about two.. genres (?) of music. These are nightcore and slowed down music. <br /> <br />
For the former, I was big on it back when I was a little kid. This is the polar opposite of the slowed down music, being very sped up instead. Yeah.. that’s it. There’s literally nothing else about it that is noteworthy. You just take any song and speed it up.. and that’s it. For something that sounds really bland, a lot of songs genuinely song really nice when sped up. I remember having a ton of “dancing sessions” where I would prefer to hear the nightcore version of a song compared to the original. I even used to have a playlist So, even though I barely listen to it now, I can’t deny that it had a large impact on me. The rush you get from hearing songs sped up was too much. You’d get it if you know about nightcore. <br /> <br />
For slowed down music, it’s literally the opposite. I mean.. it’s in the name. I feel like slowed down music is actually more popular than nightcore was, which is nuts to say as nightcore itself was really popular when I was younger. I think the likely reason is because slowed down music can be seen as “chill” or “vibe” music, which I can get. My personal favorites from this “genre” are Cyber Sex by Doja Cat, She Looks so Perfect by 5 Seconds of Summer, and Locked out of Heaven by Bruno Mars. All of these were already bops normally, but slowing them down somehow makes them even more enjoyable to listen to. <br /> <br />
I.. I am just grateful music exists in general honestly. I legit do not know where I would be if it weren’t for music. I will forever be grateful. Maybe I should go into making my own music.. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">American Food</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 8th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="American Food.png" /></center>
<p>This is very interesting to me to talk about. I feel as if America does not really have its own cuisine.. if that makes sense? I feel like all the popular food associated with America, with the exception of fast food, is from other cultures/groups of people that America just took for itself. I am not saying this to diss America, I am just saying. <br /> <br />
As a result of feeling like there is not really a specific food I had to try, writing about this topic is going to be sort of weird too. Do I talk about fast food? Because if so, that is fine. Not too different from the fast food back home. As a result, I don’t know if I like the fast food in America better than I like the fast food back home. I guess it depends? <br /> <br />
McDonald’s, for example, has nuggets that are tastier back home. They’re so much tastier, in-fact, that the American McDonald’s nuggets don’t even come close to comparing. The fries seem to taste the exact same though, so that’s at least cool. I know this is super weird, but I am a chicken nuggets person rather than burger person. I have not tried the burgers here in America from a place like McDonald’s, and I didn’t try them at the McDonald’s back home either. I can’t compare them at all thanks to this. I’m.. sure they taste the same though, yeah? <br /> <br />
One particular place I like eating at in America is a place called Panda Express. We have Chinese food places back home too, but something about this place is.. just different. The food just tastes so much better. I love that chow-mein and orange chicken combo. I eat the same combo from a place back home, but Panda Express’ meal is just so much better. <br /> <br />
Another place I like eating at is a place called Raising Cane’s. If any of my Palestinian friends are reading this, think of it as Golden Chicken from back in Beit Hanina.. but legit like a million times better. Just go look up a picture of how a meal from Raising Cane’s looks and I’m sure you’d agree. <br /> <br />
Office how I’ve just been talking about fast food? I wasn’t kidding about that essentially being America’s national food. There’s so many places I didn’t go into detail about either, like Carl’s Jr. (known as Hardee’s for us Palestinian folk), Burger King (which seems to taste the same as it did back home.. but I haven’t had it in Palestine in, like, 15 years.. so I don’t know how accurate this is), and many others. <br /> <br />
Also, yes, I notice the disturbing lack of Mexican food on here. This is made even worse when you realize I’m in California, which is like.. the hub for all things Mexican food. I’ll try to change this soon enough! Chipotle seems decent.. <br /> <br />
But, yeah. That’s basically it for now. Might’ve been super boring, but that’s the American food I’ve eaten so far. I probably gained so much weight since coming here.. yikes. Regardless, nothing compares to Palestinian food! Mulukhia stays the best of the best. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Magnify Wellness</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 7th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="Maggie.jpeg" /></center>
<p>I am currently a member of an organization known as Magnify Wellness (MW). This is an organization dedicated to improving mental health all over the world. I joined back in October earlier this year, and I cannot say how happy and honored I am to be a part of it. <br /> <br />
Mental health is super important, so being in an organization that emphasizes that is awesome. The fact that we have our own app and website makes being a member even cooler, and so does our Instagram presence. We have over 2000 followers! I know this might sound superficial, but it just feels great to be in an organization that is growing more and more everyday. <br /> <br />
I am currently on the web team, social media team, and research tram for the organization. For the web team, I am helping out with the website. I use HTML and CSS to fix it up and make it look good. For the social media team, I run the Twitter account and help out with the Instagram account. For the research team, I am researching ways to improve our app, as well as looking into how effective Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) really is. All of these roles have been extremely fulfilling and I genuinely love all of them. <br /> <br />
I am also participating in an event known as the Bay Area Global Health Innovation Challenge. The details are a bit much to go into right now, but I am essentially representing MW. I am helping out my team members so we can win $10k for MW’ sake! Anything to make the organization better. <br /> <br />
So.. yeah. That’s basically it for this post. I just wanted to talk about how cool it is to be a part of an organization like this. I’m glad! </p>


<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Fullerton College</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 6th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="FC.jpeg" /></center>
<p>The title of this post is the current college I am in. This college is a community college, and I am nearing my graduation date of May 2021. With my departure from Fullerton College (FC) being closer and closer on the horizon, I decided to write this post to reflect on my time here thus far. <br /> <br />
I was never actually supposed to come to this college. As established before, I was supposed to go to Florida. I already talked about my feelings about this with that post, so I won’t repeat them again. Anyway, my cousin convinced me to come to FC. He’s actually a chemistry professor on campus, so that was cool. I agreed to his proposition, and my first semester at FC started in August 2019. <br /> <br />
First semester of college.. was weird. It wasn’t hard, but it wasn’t easy either. It was the right amount of difficulty, I think. My classes were General Psychology, Human Biology, College Writing, and Sociology of Gender. All of these classes were dope and easy As, with the exception of Human Biology. Yeah.. that class kicked my ass and I got a C. Yikes. <br /> <br />
Second semester was a lot better due to me getting all As this time. This time, I took American Government, Public Speaking, Critical Reasoning and Writing, and Physical Geography. My Professor for American Government, Archie, was fucking dope and I still think of him from time to time. Public Speaking was horrifying but I managed to get two good friendships out of that class and a better self esteem. I don’t care about Physical Geography, and CRW was good because of me meeting my favorite Professor on campus: Professor Berry! <br /> <br />
Third semester took place during the summer, and it consisted of another 4 classes. These classes were World Religions, Physical Geography Lab, Introduction to Theatre, and Stress Management. World Religions was the most interesting out of all of these, and I loved reading all about those religions. As a former Muslim, the part about Islam was pretty interesting to read through. The Theatre class was cool too, and I don’t care about the other two classes. Another all A semester! <br /> <br />
This past semester consisted of Social Problems, British Literature to 1800, American Literature to the Civil War, and Liberal Arts Mathematics. The two English classes were dope and I made a ton of friends from them, Social Problems was garbage, and the Math class was pathetically easy. Yet again, another A semester! <br /> <br />
My next semester will consist of Calculus, British Literature Since 1800, American Literature Since the Civil War, and History of America since 1776. I hope the two English classes go as well as their predecessors, I’m horrified for Calculus, and I’m sure the History class will be chill. <br /> <br />
That’s it for the classes, but now it’s time to talk about the school itself. The campus is nice. I honestly don’t have much to say about it, it’s just nice. It’s pretty compact which makes it easy to move around, so that’s cool. Nothing is too far away so being late to class is nothing you should ever be worried about.. unless it’s your own fault. <br /> <br />
The cafeteria is cool too. My unhealthy self only ate the fatty foods from the cafeteria (like burgers and chicken tenders) but there were a lot of healthy options, which is cool. The Jamba Juice stand was nice as well if you needed a quick smoothie or something. <br /> <br />
Going back to the topic of to the classes, I feel like all of them handled the Zoom stuff pretty well.. for the most part. The aforementioned Social Problems sucked hardcore, but all the rest have taken it in stride. I especially like how the two English classes in my past Fall semester handled everything, with both of them working pretty seamlessly in the online environment. <br /> <br />
That’s pretty much it when it comes to FC. I’d talk about the environment, but I’ll leave that for its own post, if anything. Overall, I’m pretty content with spending my first two college years here, and I can’t wait to advance to an even better school! </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Hornets Tutoring</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 5th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="tutoring.png" /></center>
<p>You definitely never forget the first job you get. I can say for sure that I won’t, as it would be impossible for me anyway. I always felt “bad” for not having a job for some reason, so being able to finally get one back in August of 2020 was amazing. The job in question is a tutoring job within my college called “Hornets Tutoring.” <br /> <br />
Hornets Tutoring is all about ensuring students thrive when it comes to a variety of subjects. Our tutors literally tutor in everything when it comes to my college’s courses. I am specifically an English tutor, but I know some finance tutors as well as some economics tutors. <br /> <br />
I was pretty scared going into this job. Hell, I was scared to even apply for it in the first place. I kept having imposter syndrome and thinking I wouldn’t be good enough, but the idea of being able to make my own money and finally getting to say how I have a job kept pulling me back into the idea of applying. In the end, a good friend of mine who is a Hornets Tutor herself told me all about it and how great of a program it is, which pushed me to the edge. <br /> <br />
I applied in July and got interviewed. I remember being horrified for the interview.. like legit horrified. I heard how heard job interviews are and stuff like that, so I ended up doing a ton of prep before hand. I watched numerous videos on a variety of questions and how to answer them, and I looked up a ton of “tips” and stuff to ensure I do good during the interview. At the end, all this prep was kind of for naught. <br /> <br />
Why? Well.. the interview was actually an interview. They told us (yes, us. There were other people with me during the “interview”) how we already got accepted, which was super anti-climactic. It sucked having wasted all that time preparing, but at least I was safe rather than sorry? Regardless, I was mostly happy to hear about how things were going to go down. The “interviewers” just asked us a basic question and that was that. <br /> <br />
I was so happy after the meeting.. legit. This was going to be my first job! I was so excited. The Professor I was going to tutor for was one of my previous English professors (meaning I took her before for a class), so that was great too! I loved her and she was super nice during the class, so getting to work with her even more was something I was completely okay with. <br /> <br />
Now that my first semester of being a tutor is over, it is interesting for me to look back on this stuff. First semester was honestly nothing amazing, due to the fact that most of the students never even once asked for my help. That was pretty depressing, but I still got paid for any tutoring sessions I held over Zoom anyway, so I held no resentment.. for the most part. <br /> <br />
Hopefully my next semester goes well! I will seemingly be a lot more utilized this time around, so I hope I actually can get my money without feeling bad for never actually doing my job. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Calm</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 4th, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="Calm.png" /></center>
<p>At the end of December 2017, I started using a meditation app called Calm. I was going through a lot at the time and I really wanted to start taking care of my mental health, so this seemed like a good idea. It had nice reviews on the App Store, so I went ahead and downloaded it. <br /> <br />
At the time, Calm was nowhere near as robust as it is now. It still had a lot of options to meditate and do other mental health exercises, but not as much as it does now. I started off with doing these “7 Days of..” series of meditations. These were meditations you would do everyday for a week on a specific topic. The first one I started off with, I think, was 7 Days of Happiness. The sessions were all 10 or so minutes in length, and were narrated by someone named Tamara Levitt. She is actually the founder of Calm, so listening to her voice was cool. <br /> <br />
These meditations sucked though. Not because they themselves were bad, but because I could not meditate for the life of me. It was difficult to consistently pay attention and not keep getting distracted, and I sometimes would even fall asleep. Tamara’s voice is just super relaxing, okay? I improved with time, but these first starting sessions were tough. <br /> <br />
After I was done with the variety of “7 Days of..” options, I could not do much else. Calm had a premium option so you can access the rest of the content, but I could not buy this at the time. As a result, I practically could only do the “timed meditations” option. This was literally just a timer you can set for whenever you want to mediate. Helpful, but not enough. I was still a newcomer to meditation at this point, so just a timer with no narration was not what I wanted.. at least not yet. <br /> <br />
Because of this, I bought the Premium option sometime during October last year. When I did, I literally had access to so many new things it was insane. If I’m being honest, I can’t even list out all of them cause there was so much to the point where I don’t remember how much I got exactly, I just know it was a lot. <br /> <br />
When the plethora of options became available to me, I really took a liking to the “Daily Calm.” This is a daily meditation that goes over a random topic for about 10 minutes. I have been doing this ever since it became available to me, and it’s honestly super fun. I sincerely doubt that Calm actually has 365 days worth of original Daily Calms (meaning they definitely recycle the same topics from time to time), but it’s still fresh enough with variety that I don’t really mind. <br /> <br />
There’s more options, and I genuinely think you should just download the app yourself and check them out. You can still see them, you just can’t actually access them. I would list them, but again, there’s just so much. Kinda sad that so much helpful stuff is locked behind paying, but oh well. <br /> <br />
One last thing I want to mention about Calm is the background ambiance. While you’re browsing through the menus, you can set a variety of “themes” to run in the background. These entail a nice and scenic picture (or a gif in some cases) along with some accompanying “music.” One of the themes is of the auroras and has white noise as the ambiance track in the background. This is so relaxing, and it genuinely made my experience with Calm even better. Such a simple and small thing, but yeah, I love white noise so this is a treat for me. <br /> <br />
Overall, I highly recommend Calm. I’ve definitely been a lot better when it comes to my mental health and how to take care of it after using the app for as long as I have. I’m still subscribed to the premium option and I doubt I’ll get rid of it anytime soon. Really convenient. </p>
<h3 style="color: #33cccc;">Tarot Cards</h3>
<div><h4 style="color: #33cccc;">December 3rd, 2020</h4></div>
<center><img src="TC.jpeg" /></center>
<p>I never thought I would ever be writing on a topic related to fortune telling, but here I am. <br /> <br />
Tarot Cards are a set of cards that seemingly dictate things about you and your future. They dictate things like your love life, your struggles, and are used by fortune tellers to do readings for your your destiny.. or whatever. I don’t really believe in this stuff, mainly because I think it is superstitious nonsense, but I cannot deny that it is pretty cool to read up on. <br /> <br />
I found out about them through a video game series I play called Persona. In the games, they act the same way they do in real life. Each character in the game is assigned a specific Tarot Card (or “Arcana” as they’re called in the game), and this entails their personality. It also entails how their character development will happen throughout the game. For example: the Wheel of Fortune Tarot Card is all about choices and making decisions. For a character in one of the Persona games, this comes in the way of them having to make a variety of choices relating to their family and their past, all which accumulate to create a positive future for said character. Sounds kind of basic I am sure, but the games use each of the Tarot Cards to their advantage. <br /> <br />
I did a “which Tarot Card are you?” quiz many times before, usually getting The Sun, The Moon, The Star, The Strength and The Hermit. The Hermit is kind of obvious from the name, but I do not necessarily think I am a hermit anymore. I have become much more social in recent times, which while that does not get rid of my introverted-ness, I still think it changes it up enough to where I can’t be considered The Hermit any longer. The Strength is all about facing lots of adversity but still managing to come out on top. Yeah, I can see myself in this brief description for sure. The Star seems to mainly focus on the aspect of hope, with the person who is a Star always finding the best in everything and consistently staying hopeful no matter what. I think this describes me the most out of all the other results I got, as I can definitely say I am full of hope. I’ll go into this with another blog post, but yeah. <br /> <br />
As for The Sun and The Moon, with the former being about a great destiny and the latter being about deceit. For The Sun, I sure hope I have a good future. For The Moon, this card symbolizes a period of time where something is seemingly not the way it should be. Uh.. I am lying about something? Yeah.. I can guess what that something is. I’ll leave that for another post too, if anything. <br /> <br />
Even though I am content with assuming I am a Star, I always wanted to be a Lovers. This Tarot Card is all about relationships and the choices you make within said relationships. I value my relationships greatly, so I am quite surprised I never got it once as a result from any of those quizzes. I mean.. I guess I should probably go to an actual fortune teller to know my true Tarot, but still. <br /> <br />
I’ll continue looking into these cards, and I might just start believing in this superstitious stuff after-all..</p>
